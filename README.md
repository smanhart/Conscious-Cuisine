# Conscious-Cuisine

Conscious-Cuisine was our first team project. We all enjoy cooking and discusssed the challenge of finding nutrition information for recipes we find online. We decided to develop an application that utilized API calls to find recipes based on an ingredient and provide nutrition information for each result. 

The application was built using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Sass, AJAX, Yummly API to retreive recipe information from the ingredient search, and Edamam API to retrieve the nutrition information for the chosen recipe.
